# MHCMT
The Mental Health Chatbot with Mood Tracking (MHCMT) is a full-stack web application designed to offer accessible and interactive mental health support to users. Mental well-being plays a vital role in our overall health, but many people hesitate to talk about their feelings or don’t have access to professional help.
